# M8 Headless Setup
## What is M8 Headless?
M8 Headless is a software package that allows you to run the M8 software on a Teensy device while using your computer's keyboard, monitor, and audio output. It is a low-cost alternative to purchasing an M8 handheld device.

# What You Need
## Hardware
To set up M8 Headless, you need to purchase a few things (total cost $35-100 USD):
1. **Teensy 4.1** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088D3FWR7/), $30 USD) ([PJRC](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html), $27 USD): This is a microcontroller that the M8 software runs on; it's the M8's brain without the screen and keyboard. **Note:** You must have a **Teensy 4.1**; a 4.0 or earlier version will not work.
1. **microSD Card**: The microSD card is used to store your instruments, songs, samples, and more. Not all microSD cards work well on M8. You need one with good random read/write speeds. The following cards are known to work well:
   - Lexar Professional 1800x 64GB (Expensive, but works well, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QM348D9/), $64 USD)
   - Sandisk 32GB Ultra microSDHC (Cheaper, but reliable, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M55C0NS/), $8 USD)
1. **microUSB Cable**: You probably already have a million of these, but you'll need one for this!
1. **(Optional) microSD Card Reader**: If your computer does not have a built-in microSD card reader, you'll need to purchase one.
1. **(Optional) Numpad or Gamepad**: A small USB numpad keyboard or gamepad can be useful for simulating the keys on the M8 handheld. If you don't have one of these, you can still use your normal keyboard.

## Software
There's a few pieces of software you need to install to set up M8 Headless:
1. **TyTools:** This is used to install the M8 Headless firmware on your Teensy device. To install it:
   1. Visit [https://github.com/Koromix/tytools/releases](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools/releases).
   1. Click on the link most recent version available for your operating system to download TyTools
      - **For Mac OS:** Choose the most recent TyTools-x.x.x-osx.dmg file.

# Installation Steps
## Step 1: Format the microSD Card

{: .note .info}
**You only need to do this step if you are reusing an old microSD card. If this doesn't apply to you, skip to Step 2.**

{: .note .warning}
**This step will delete everything on your microSD card. Backup any important data on it before proceeding.**

If you aren't using a brand new microSD card, it needs to be formatted correctly for it to be usable with M8 Headless.

### For microSD Cards 32GB or Less
1. Plug in your microSD card to your computer.
1. Open the SD Card Formatter tool you installed previously.

   {: .note .warning}
   **Don't use the formatter tool built-in to Mac OS/Windows, or you may get unpredictable results.**
   1. In the **Select card** section, select your microSD card.
   1. In the **Formatting options** section, choose **Quick format**.
   1. Click **Format** and wait for the process to complete.
1. Unplug the microSD card from your computer.

### For microSD Cards Larger than 32GB
1. Plug in your microSD card to your computer.
1. Format the card:
   - On **Windows:**
      1. Open **Explorer** and right-click on the microSD card. Select **Format...**
      1. Set the **File system** to **exFAT**.
      1. Check the **Quick Format** box.

1. Plug in your microUSB cable to your Teensy device, and plug the other end **directly** into your computer.

    {: .note .warning}
    **Do not plug the USB cable into a USB hub, or you may run into problems!**
1. Open the TyUpdater tool that was part of the TyTools installation you performed earlier. Another app called TyCommander was installed too, but that's not what you want.
1. You should see your Teensy device in the dropdown list. It may be named something like "HalfKay," "Teensyduino," or "M8" if there is existing M8 firmware on the device. Make sure your device is selected.
1. Click the Upload button.
1. Select the .hex file you downloaded earlier.
1. Wait for the process to complete. The device's name should change to **M8** in the dropdown.

## Step 3: Install M8 TouchDesigner and Run M8 Headless
Finally, we need to install the M8 TouchDesigner app that lets your computer communicate with the  M8 Teensy. To do this:
1. Download the latest M8 TouchDesigner app. To do this:
